# CricketData_MathExploration

This is a program that I developed to extract data about cricket matches that was stored in .yaml files and perform certain analyses on it. The program was created for my Math Internal Assessment for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. 

The Cricket class is responsible for extracting data from the .yaml files and storing them in data structures more conducive to data analysis. Relevant methods that will aid in data analysis have also been defined in this class.

The Main class performs the data analysis. 

The paper for which this analysis was performed is also provided.
